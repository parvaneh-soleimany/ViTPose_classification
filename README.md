# ViTPose_classification
This repository provides a classification model on ViTPose data for the Machine learning Intern Assignment for Body.Scratch

## Installation
The purpose of this assignment is to classify the different poses based on the 17 key points of the body.

## Input
The list of numpy arrays which stored heatmap which is the output of ViTPose. The shape of each numpy file is [1, 17, 64, 48] which corresponds to 17 key points in the body. All numpy files in the same folder belong to the same class. There are a total of 17 classes (action_down, action_inside, action_new, â€¦.).
